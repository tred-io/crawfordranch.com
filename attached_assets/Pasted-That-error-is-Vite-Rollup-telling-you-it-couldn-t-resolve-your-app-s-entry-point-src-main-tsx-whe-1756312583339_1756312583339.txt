That error is Vite/Rollup telling you it couldnâ€™t resolve your appâ€™s entry point (/src/main.tsx) when bundling. In other words:
when Rollup was processing your index.html in client/, it saw a script tag like:

<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>


â€¦but it couldnâ€™t actually find that file from the build context on Vercel.

Common causes

Wrong path in index.html

If your index.html is in client/, and your source is in client/src/main.tsx, then the script tag should usually be:

<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>


(that assumes root in vite.config.ts is client).

If your Vite root isnâ€™t set to client, Rollup will look for /src/main.tsx at the repo root and fail.

Incorrect Vite root setting

In vite.config.ts, if you have:

export default defineConfig({
  root: "client",
})


then Vite knows to resolve from inside client/.

Without that, it will resolve /src/main.tsx relative to the repo root and fail.

File missing / misnamed

Maybe itâ€™s actually main.ts or main.jsx, not main.tsx.

Or the file lives in client/src/ but your index.html is trying to load from /src/.

Build command mismatch

Your Vercel build command is:

cd client && npm install && npm run build && cd .. && npm run build:server


If your Vite build expects to run from inside client/, make sure that vite.config.ts root aligns with that.

Sometimes you donâ€™t need to cd client if your monorepo is already set up with workspaces.

How to fix

Check client/index.html
Ensure the script tag points correctly:

<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>


If index.html is already inside client/, thatâ€™s correct only if Vite root is client. Otherwise change to:

<script type="module" src="./src/main.tsx"></script>


Set root in vite.config.ts:

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  root: 'client',
  plugins: [react()],
})


Double-check file existence
Confirm you actually have client/src/main.tsx.

ðŸ‘‰ To debug locally, run:

cd client
npm run build


If it fails the same way, adjust root or index.html. If it works locally but fails on Vercel, likely your Vercel project root/build settings are pointed at the wrong directory.

Do you want me to look at your vite.config.ts and index.html and show you exactly how those should line up for a client/ subfolder setup?
