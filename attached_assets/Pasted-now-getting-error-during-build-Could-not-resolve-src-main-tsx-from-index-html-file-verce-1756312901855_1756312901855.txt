Got it — this new error tells us Vite still can’t see client/src/main.tsx when resolving from index.html.

Let’s carefully line things up:

1. Current setup

vite.config.ts has:

root: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "client"),


That means Vite’s root directory is client/.
So it expects:

client/index.html

client/src/main.tsx

Your error says:

Could not resolve "./src/main.tsx" from "index.html"
file: /vercel/path0/client/index.html


→ That means Vite is looking for /vercel/path0/client/src/main.tsx and it’s not finding it.

2. Things to double-check

Do you actually have this file in your repo?

client/src/main.tsx


with exactly that casing (main.tsx)?

Or is it:

client/src/main.ts (no x)

Client/src/Main.tsx (uppercase)

client/app/main.tsx (different folder)?

On Vercel (Linux), casing and exact path matter.

3. How to fix

Option A (if file exists at client/src/main.tsx):

Put this in client/index.html:

<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>


Keep vite.config.ts with root: "client".

That combination is the normal Vite setup for projects where the root is client.

Option B (if your main.tsx is NOT inside client/src)

Move it there (recommended), or update your import path in index.html to wherever it actually lives.

Example: if it’s at client/main.tsx, then in index.html you’d need:

<script type="module" src="/main.tsx"></script>

4. Why ./src/main.tsx failed

When you set root: client, Rollup expects paths in index.html to be root-relative (/src/...), not relative (./src/...).
So "./src/main.tsx" breaks, but "/src/main.tsx" works (assuming the file exists).
