# Crawford Ranch Redesign - Implementation Summary

## Project Completed: October 14, 2025

---

## Overview

Successfully refactored and restyled the Crawford Ranch website to achieve an upscale, Alisal Ranch-inspired design while maintaining authentic Central Texas Hill Country character. All requirements met and production-ready.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Design System

**New Color Palette**:
- Maintained Texas Maroon (`hsl(357, 85%, 25%)`) as primary brand color
- Added Sage Teal (`hsl(180, 25%, 55%)`) as sophistication accent
- Refined Ranch Cream background to lighter, more elegant shade

**Typography**:
- **Playfair Display** for all headings (elegant serif)
- **Inter** for body text (clean sans-serif)
- Removed Merriweather and Crimson Text
- Proper weight scale: 300-700 (Inter), 400-900 (Playfair)

**Decorative Elements**:
- Decorative horizontal lines for headings
- Subtle textured backgrounds (diagonal stripes)
- Ken Burns animation for hero images
- Refined hover effects and transitions

---

### 2. Navigation & Header

**New Header Design**:
- **Centered logo** that starts large and shrinks on scroll
- **Left side**: Hamburger menu opening sidebar
- **Right side**: Persistent "Book Now" button
- Smooth 500ms transitions between states
- Transparent → white background on scroll

**Sidebar Menu**:
- Opens from left side
- Ranch cream background
- Updated navigation items:
  - Home
  - Events & Outfitting
  - Corporate Retreats
  - Activities / Trails
  - Gallery
  - About
  - Contact
- **Excluded**: Lodging (per requirements)
- **Removed from nav**: Outfitter (route still exists for legacy links)

---

### 3. Hero Section

**Hero Carousel Component** (`client/src/components/hero-carousel.tsx`):
- Auto-rotating image carousel (7-second intervals)
