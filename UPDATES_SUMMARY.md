## Changes Completed: October 14, 2025

---

## 1. Hero Carousel - Added 3 More Images ✅

**Changed**: Expanded hero carousel from 3 to 6 images

**New Slides Added**:

---

## 2. Navigation Bar - Complete Overhaul ✅

**Issues Fixed**:
- Logo weird shape/padding → Now uses `object-fit: contain` with proper centering
- Hamburger white on off-white → Now maroon color (`text-texas-maroon`) on all backgrounds
- Small hamburger icon → Increased to `h-8 w-8` (was `h-6 w-6`)
- Navbar too subtle → Now larger, more defined, always visible

**New Navbar Specs**:
- **Background**: Always white (`bg-white/98` initially, `bg-white` when scrolled)
- **Padding**: `py-6` initially, `py-3` when scrolled (taller navbar)
- **Shadow**: Always visible (`shadow-md` initially, `shadow-lg` when scrolled)
- **Hamburger**:
  - Size: 12x12 button with 8x8 icon
  - Color: Texas maroon (visible on all backgrounds)
  - Hover: Ranch cream background
- **Logo**:
  - Properly centered with `object-contain`
  - Size: `h-16 to h-24` initially, `h-12 to h-14` when scrolled

  - Always maroon background
  - Size: `px-6 py-5` (larger)
  - Hover: Lighter maroon + shadow lift

## 3. Background Colors - Crisp White ✅

**Changed**: Ranch cream from off-white to crisp white

**Before**: `hsl(45, 35%, 94%)` (warm off-white)
**After**: `hsl(0, 0%, 98%)` (crisp, clean white)

**Impact**: Cleaner, more professional appearance while still warm

---

## 5. Fixed Links Throughout Site ✅

## 6. Book Now Button - Hover Effects ✅

**Button State Transitions**:
```css
Normal: bg-texas-maroon, no shadow
Hover: bg-texas-maroon-light + shadow-lg
Transition: 300ms smooth
```

**Applied To**:
- Header "Book Now" button
- All "Book Now" buttons on highlight cards
- CTA buttons throughout site

---

## 7. Contact Form - Event Type Prefill ✅

**Issue**: URL parameter `eventType` not populating dropdown

**Root Cause**: Select component using `defaultValue` instead of `value`

**Fix**: Changed to controlled component with `value={field.value}`

**Before**:
```tsx
<Select onValueChange={field.onChange} defaultValue={field.value}>
```

**After**:
```tsx
<Select onValueChange={field.onChange} value={field.value}>
```

**Test URLs That Now Work**:
```
/contact?eventType=Wedding
/contact?eventType=Corporate%20Retreat
/contact?context=corporate&eventType=Corporate%20Retreat&source=corporate-hero
```

**Verification**: Dropdown now correctly displays the pre-selected event type
